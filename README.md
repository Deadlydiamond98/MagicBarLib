# Magic Bar Lib

<p align="center">
Magic Bar Lib is a simple library mod that adds a mana bar to minecraft, 
along with some helper methods and items. It was primarily made for The Legend of Steve (a mod I'm working on)
But I can see it being useful for other people wanting to implement a mana bar. It's fairly barebones right now,
but I expect it to gain more functionalities as I continue work on my mods.
